        <a target="blank" class="about-links" href="https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/grill/BestOf?oid=2207871">Grill</a> was an iconic 24-hour diner and bar (The Red Room) located in the heart of downtown Tucson.  Whether you were there for a 24 ounce Porterhouse, Tots with pesto dressing, the Freaking Great Tortellini, or for the live music and booze, Grill was a place you could go to at any hour of the day and enjoy good things.  As the saying goes all good things must come to an end, but love it or hate it we all made some lasting memories at Grill before we had to say <a target="blank" class="about-links" href = "https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/grill-1994-2011/Content?oid=4798557">goodbye</a>.

He has contributed to the development of an electromyography device designed to analyze an athlete's performance during a workout. His specific contribution included the development of an algorithm to determine the start and end points of each individual repetition during a workout, allowing the data associated with each repetition to be isolated for further analysis.
